                                Taking the road less taken can turn out to be one of the most fulfilling experiences of a lifetime. There is hardly any joy in doing the things everyone can do. But there is a joy mighty sweet when you succeed on a road less taken and become an inspiration for generations to come.
                                
                                 
                                
                                Starting a business can turn out to be one of the most interesting experiences of your life. One of the important decisions made by an entrepreneur or a start-up while starting this journey is the selection of his business entity. The choice of the business entity has long term implications throughout the life-cycle of the business. Hence, it is recommended to discuss your business plan with a professional, and choose an entity that will support the vision of the business.
                                
                                 
                                
                                Cut to the chase; we highly recommend you opt for setting up a Private Limited Company. Read on and you’ll understand why.
                                
                                 
                                
                                A Private Limited Company is the most popular as well as the most preferred choice of business entity in India. As it requires a minimum of 2 members, it is most appropriate for small and medium-sized businesses and start-ups. It is a privately held business entity with a limited liability and allows for a 100% foreign direct investment with government approval. It takes only around two weeks to set up a Private Limited Company. It also allows a significant degree of distinction between the business entity and the management.
